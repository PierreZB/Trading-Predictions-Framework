# Trading Predictions Framework (TPF)

This project's goal is to set-up a framework to be able to
- pull trading data for different instruments at different granularities
- calculate a set of indicators
- join entry and exit strategies
- apply machine learning on the data set to get predictions, based on the indicators and the strategy

In this Phase 1 (started September 2018), we will use Oanda as a source for the trading data, python to extract and transform, and orange to build the predictive model.
Therefore, this GitHub project will gather python codes extracting from the Oanda API and transforming it, and storing the output into csv files.
